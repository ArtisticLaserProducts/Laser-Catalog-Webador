Imperial Airship Important NOTE:

Hi.
Thank you for considering purchasing our Imperial
Airship pattern. When we developed our Steam Punk
Series we designed this ship based on artwork by
a friend of ours from whom we obtained permission.
The model worked out well except when we beta tested
it we discovered that the amount of slices of plywood
in the hull of the ship made the model heavy.
We had to cut some small squares of plywood and glue them
in various places between the hull slices to support
the weight. Due to this we were not going to release 
this pattern to the public. 
However, we have decided to do so because it's such an
attractive model. 
Please be aware before purchase that you may have to 
insert support squares as you build this for it to work.
You should only purchase it with that understanding.
