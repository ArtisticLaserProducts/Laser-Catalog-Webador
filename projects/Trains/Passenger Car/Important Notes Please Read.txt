In this puzzle the green layer (Layer 1) Is to be cut from double the thickness of the rest of the puzzle.
Example in a 1-4 (.25) inch puzzle you would cut the green layer (Layer 1) out of 1/2 (.5) inch wood.

Also in this puzzles assembly guide, the photo of the parts list shows there being three train hooks when
there is only supposed to be two. The dxf is correct. We are sorry for an confusion this may have caused.
