Upgrade notes for dirt bike

we have made a lot of upgrades to this model for better fitting parts and a better look
  the Seat is now Inside the Frame.   This Stops Any Bending of the parts to put it together. 
I Could Make it Go on the Outsides of the Frame, but that would look Pretty Wide, so the inside is the Best Solution.     it’s Fine the way it is Now   


 it was Necessary to ADD 2 more WHEELS.    .  

If,   you were to Add Some Spacer Washers,  it would Offset the wheels to the Bike, and Look Kind-a Funny.    So I added the second Wheel.  
Actually, I think it looks Better with 4 deep, 

there were many other small updates to help make it a better model with much better fitting parts
